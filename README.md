**In this repository you can find all the code from my experiments with neural networks. The goal is to learn the math and logic behind neural networks more thoroughly and how/why certain functionalities of the Tensorflow library are used.**

## Libraries Used

As the goal with this project is to learn more about neural networks and not general math and development, some libraries were used. The libraries used are for instance NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib as seen in the badges at the top of this document.

## The Library Itself

### Model

### Layers

### Neurons
